  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>Pepperi is an omnichannel B2B sales platform for brands and wholesale distributors.</strong></p>
<p>Pepperi connects <a href="https://www.pepperi.com/sales-force-automation-2/">Sales Force Automation</a> with <a href="https://www.pepperi.com/b2b-e-commerce/">B2B eCommerce</a> on an enterprise-grade cloud platform, so you can sell bigger, smarter and faster, and easily adapt to market dynamics.</p>
<p>The Pepperi Platform includes a B2B eCommerce module, allowing distributors to provide their customers with self-service ordering online, or using the Pepperi native apps (iOS and Android). Buyers log in to a branded environment, and see the catalogs, price lists and promotions relevant to them.</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OUT THERE WHO WANT TO BROWSE YOUR PRODUCTS?</p>
<p>Our Open Catalog allows you to improve your marketing efforts to attract more traffic to your site and convert visitors to customers.</p>
<p>Pepperi’s Open Catalog Plugin for WordPress allows distributors and wholesalers using the Pepperi B2B eCommerce module to share their product catalog with potential customers as an open catalog with no login required.</p>
<p>You can also enable a “sign up” link, converting your potential customers to customers who can place orders in Pepperi’s B2B ecommerce for online ordering.</p>
<p>SEAMLESSLY PRESENT YOUR PRODUCTS ON YOUR WEBSITE IN A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY.</p>
<p>The Open Catalog has a modern look and feel, providing smart tools for search and filtering and uses the latest technologies for fast response time  . All this, using existing Pepperi data and configuration tools.</p>
<p>Pepperi Open Catalog is aligned with the Pepperi look and feel.</p>
<p>The open catalog includes several components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exporter</strong> – The exporter takes the product data and UI definitions as defined in the Pepperi back office and exports them to a dedicated Elastic database – optimized for searches, filtering, and scalable for multi concurrent users.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Once the data resides in the optimized Elastic database , Pepperi provides an API that can be used by customers to build their own headless design. It is also used by Pepperi as part of the out of the box Open Catalog solution.</li>
<li><strong>UI Components</strong> – out of the box Pepperi UI components designed for a product catalog such as a category tree, filters, search, product strip area and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once deployed, you can customize and fine tune the open catalog using a familiar WordPress plugin interface.</p>
